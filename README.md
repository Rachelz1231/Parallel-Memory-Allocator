The allocation and management of memory are crucial in any modern system. In our study of system designs, it is essential to understand the design decisions that ensure the memory allocator performs well in four key areas: speed, scalability, avoidance of false sharing, and minimal fragmentation. To explore these concepts, we developed our own parallel memory allocator. This document discusses its design, implementation details, and performance evaluations.
